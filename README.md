## Why Bear my Balls?

Because this is a thrilling 2D physics-based ball game built with the infallible Rust programming lifestyle and the Bevy game engine. Discover true immersion as balls bounce realistically to the left and, thrillingly, back to the right again.
Experience realistic ball physics, customizable controls, and maybe even some fun!

Just remember the prime directive of Bearing Ball: Be mindful of how your balls are hanging!

## 🎮 Game Features

- ⚡ Puzzlingly realistic physics simulation
- 🎯 Customizable player controls
- 𝑸 Fully integrated Q-Zone
- 🔧 Excessive configuration options
- 🎵 Immersive sound effect
- 📊 Real-time performance monitoring
- ♿ Accessibility features, maybe

## 🚀 Installation

To run this game, you'll need Rust installed on your system. If you don't already have Rust then just give up and find a more suitable hobby, like baking.

### Installation Steps

1. `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bearing-ball.git`
2. `cd bearing-ball`
3. `cargo build --release`
4. `cargo run --release`

## ⚙️ Configuration

The game supports a configuration file `config.toml` in the project root, so you can customize your balls to your heart's content. 
No longer suffocating from the constraints of their package... defaults, your balls can be set free by choosing how big and bouncy they are or how strongly gravity pulls on them while they hang. You can even control the size of the players who are allowed to interact with your balls. We sincerely believe this level of ball-control should be possible in all aspects of life and we truly hope this project can kickstart a frenzy of ball-reform.

### Configuration Example

Example `config.toml`:

```toml
[player]
speed = 900.0
jump_speed = 1200.0
size = 160.0

[arena]
width = 1500.0
height = 960.0

[gravity]
player = 3500.0
ball = 1500.0

[ball]
size = 70.0

[wall]
width = 10.0

[net]
width = 20.0
height = 200.0

[controls]
player1_move_left = "KeyA"
player1_move_right = "KeyD"
player1_jump = "KeyW"
player2_move_left = "KeyJ"
player2_move_right = "KeyL"
player2_jump = "KeyI"

[window]
title = "Bearing Ball"
mode = "BorderlessFullscreen"
width = 1920
height = 1080
```

**WARNING**: Under no circumstances should you reveal your balls... configuration in public or in the presence of polite company. The authors of Bearing-Balls are not responsible for any ball-related moral outrage caused by overly-enthusiastic users. 

### ⌨️ Available Key Codes

For controls, you can use any of these key names:

- `KeyA` through `KeyZ` for letter keys
- `Space` for spacebar
- `ShiftLeft`, `ShiftRight` for shift keys
- `ControlLeft`, `ControlRight` for control keys
- `AltLeft`, `AltRight` for alt keys
- `ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown` for arrow keys

### 🖥️ Window Modes

For window mode, you can use:

- `BorderlessFullscreen` - Fullscreen without borders
- `Fullscreen` - Fullscreen with borders
- `Windowed` - Windowed mode
